# eeps
eeps, an Entity Engine Processing System for Python and Crystal.

The goal of this implemenation is a clean api that *I* enjoy using. It focuses on being easy to use, flexabilty, and not making me gasp in horror, rather than speed or purity.

see example.py or example.cr for a full demonstration of usage.
